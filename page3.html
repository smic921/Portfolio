                <h3>Through the experiences I went through during Guatemala trip, not only did I help build facilities that villagers desperately needed, I was also able to deliver them a message of hope; and, in turn, they were able to teach me the importance of hard work and appreciating what you have in life. I participated in three different trips. I have been to Dominican Republic in 2015, and I visited Guatemala in 2016 and 2017. </h3>
